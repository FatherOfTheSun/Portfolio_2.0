            My name is Reese Borchers, I have recently just begun to be a full-stack devleoper
            My fiance Ashley is my other half, I wouldnt be here without her, she has her degree
            in Graphic Design. We have two wonderful boys, Asher is 7 and Apollo is 18 months.
            We are a very active family and enjoy any sport or activity from Snowboarding in
            Colorado to Paddleboarding or Wakeboarding at the Lake. In my spare time I enjoy
            researching green energy and new farming technics, in hopes to help provide a new
            ways of being self-effienct.
